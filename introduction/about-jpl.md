# About the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is located on the outskirts of Pasadena, California. Founded in 1936 by California Institute of Technology (Caltech) researchers, JPL is a research and development lab federally funded by NASA and managed by Caltech.

[JPL leads the U.S. portion of the NISAR project on behalf of NASA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/press-kits/nisar/mission-overview/spacecraft/), and [provided the following components for the mission](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/nisar/about-the-satellite/): 
* the L-band radar instrument
* the antenna boom (the reflector was built by Astro Aerospace)
* a high-rate communication subsystem for science data
* GPS receivers
* a solid-state recorder
* a power distribution unit
* a payload data subsystem

JPL also oversaw the pre-launch testing of the radar antenna reflector and boom, and implemented remediation efforts to [address thermal vulnerabilities identified prior to launch](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia26419-nisar-radar-antenna-reflector-loaded-for-return-to-india/).
