# Overview

This page summarizes the data products available from the NISAR mission.

## Level 3

Level 3 products represent geophysical parameters derived from radar-specific parameters and geocoded to a geographic grid.

- The [Soil Moisture (SME2) product](level-3/sme2.md) ...

## Level 2

Level 2 products are derived radar-specific parameters resampled and geocoded to a geographic grid.

- The [Geocoded SLC (GSLC)](level-2/gslc.md) product ...
- The [Geocoded Pixel Offsets (GOFF)](level-2/goff.md) product ...
- The [Geocoded Polarimetric Covariance Matrix (GCOV)](level-2/gcov.md) product ...
- The [Geocoded Unwrapped Interferogram (GUNW)](level-2/gunw.md) product ...

## Level 1

Level 1 products are processed instrument data, focused to full resolution complex images, time referenced and annotated with ancillary information, including radiometric and relevant geometric calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters (i.e. platform ephemeris) computed and appended, in natural radar coordinates.

- The [Range-Doppler Single Look Complex (RSLC)](level-1/rslc.md) product contains focused SAR images in range-Doppler coordinates.
- The [Range-Doppler Interferogram (RIFG)](level-1/rifg.md) product is a multi-looked interferogram in range doppler coordinates.
- The [Range-Doppler Pixel Offsets (ROFF)](level-1/roff.md) product ...
- The [Range-Doppler Unwrapped Interferogram (RUNW)](level-1/runw.md) product ...

## Level 0

Level 0 products are unprocessed instrument data.

- The [Radar Raw Signal Data (RRSD)](level-0/rrsd.md) product contains corrected, aligned radar pulse data.
